How to run code and model:

Requirements:
Matlab 2022a+
Matlab Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

Notes:
It will take a long time to run with only CPU acceleration.
If testing each segment using run segment button, not all sections have RNG set to 123456 at start of section so results will differ.
	Running code all together uses same RNG.

Steps:
1. Download code and datasets from repo: https://github.com/andyc1021/ML_assignment_1
2. Launch MATLAB from folder with all code and datasets
3. Include the two .m files and the two data files (PM_train.xlsx, apple_quality.csv) to MATLAB path
4. Open Assignment_1_Supervised_Learning.m
5. Run Play button on script and should run automatically, generating figures and saving off figures to local working directory.
